# gmod_personal_dump

Shitty stuff I've made over the years, some of it goes back to 2009 when I started coding in Lua, so it's pretty bad.

There's quite a lot of copypasting from other's people work, which shouldn't be surprising really, as most of this stuff was personal, except for stuff I'm ashamed of releasing.

Still, sentimental attachments are pretty hard to get rid of.
