Eli's first attempt at making the gravity gun we all love,he thought it would be actually cool to punt stuff out of the way than just picking them up,and repulsing yourself along the map would be funnier 
This weapon has no organic protection,so you can just punt ragdolls and npcs. 
Primary Attack: punt attack,punt everything in your way (although the damage may be little,you can tune it within the puntcannon_damage and puntcannon_megadamage convars). 
Secondary attack: puntcannon energy charge,the gun starts charging energy until it's full,press primary attack to release the burst,or use the secondary attack again to upgrade it to the super state.

Note: don't submerge the gun while charging,never.
