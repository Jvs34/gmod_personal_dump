 opens up the voicemenu corresponding to the number.

There are 4 modules in this addon.




-Player status:
 a minimalist hud replica that shows your current weapon,health,battery, and the ones of other players
 connected to the server
-Player Inventory Viewer:
 a module that shows you all your weapons and current ammo,hl2dm pro style (an old sourcemod,sigh,that
 was really funny to play)
-Items finder
 i need to credit AndrewMcWatters (CptFuzzies) for giving me code snippets to create this module.
 This will show you items and weapons dropped on the ground,if you are at least in 1000 units of range.
 You will even see the dropped weapons' ammo. 
-Voicemenu
 A source engine voicecommand replica,you can execute only one command at a time.
 To edit it just follow the comments in the module file.
